# Introduction

This is an case study for the lesson titled: Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study on Coursera.

**Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?**
([Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)).

We work for a bike-share company and our goal is to maximize the number of our annual memberships. Therefore, 
we need to understand how casual and annual riders use differently our services.

Some more information:
- More than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations
- Around 8% of riders use assistive options. 
- Users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
