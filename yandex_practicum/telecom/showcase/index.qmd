## Executive Summary

Customer churn poses a significant revenue risk in telecom services.  
This project builds a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churn and uncovers the key drivers behind churn behavior.

The emphasis is not only on prediction accuracy, but on business interpretability and decision support.

## Business Context

Retention campaigns are expensive and must be targeted.  
A predictive churn model allows the business to:

- Identify high-risk customers early
- Understand churn drivers
- Allocate retention budgets efficiently

---

## Analytical Approach

### Exploratory Analysis
Initial exploration focused on:
- Churn distribution and imbalance
- Behavioral differences between churned and retained customers

### Feature Engineering
- Categorical encoding
- Numerical scaling
- Leakage prevention

### Modeling Strategy
- Baseline comparison
- Tree-based classification
- Metric selection aligned with retention goals

---

## Results & Insights

- The final model shows strong discriminatory power
- Contract type and tenure are the most influential features
- High-risk segments can be clearly identified

---

## Business Implications

Rather than offering incentives to all customers, the model enables:
- Targeted retention offers
- Reduced incentive costs
- Data-driven churn mitigation
