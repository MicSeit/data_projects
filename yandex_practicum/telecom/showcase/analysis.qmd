## Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major revenue risk for telecommunications providers.  
The objective of this analysis is to identify customers at high risk of churn and understand the key factors driving churn behavior.

This project focuses on:
- Predicting churn using supervised machine learning
- Identifying the most influential churn drivers
- Translating predictions into actionable business insights

From a business perspective, retention actions are costly and should be targeted.  
An accurate churn model enables prioritization of customers who are most likely to leave, improving the efficiency of retention campaigns.

## Data Overview

The dataset contains customer-level information including:
- Demographic attributes
- Contract and service details
- Usage behavior
- Billing and tenure information

The target variable is a binary indicator of customer churn.

Initial inspection revealed class imbalance, with churned customers representing a minority of the dataset.  
This informed metric selection during modeling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory analysis focused on identifying behavioral and contractual patterns associated with churn.

### Churn Distribution

The dataset exhibits class imbalance, with a smaller proportion of customers churning.
This reinforces the need for evaluation metrics beyond accuracy.
