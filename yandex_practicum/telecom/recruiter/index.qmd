## Project Summary

This project predicts customer churn for a telecommunications provider using machine learning.  
The objective is to identify high-risk customers and uncover the primary drivers of churn to support retention strategies.

---

## Business Problem

Customer churn reduces revenue and increases acquisition costs.  
This analysis answers three key questions:

- Which customers are most likely to churn?
- What factors drive churn behavior?
- How can predictions support proactive retention?

---

## Data & Methods

**Data**
- Customer demographics
- Contract and service information
- Billing and tenure metrics

**Methods**
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Supervised classification modeling
- Evaluation using ROC-AUC and recall

---

## Key Results

- The final model significantly outperforms a baseline classifier
- Contract type and tenure are the strongest churn predictors
- Model outputs can be used to prioritize retention campaigns
