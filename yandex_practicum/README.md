# Timeline
Estimated timeline of the project:

- Data preprocessing ~ Day 1
- Exploratory data analysis ~ Day 1-2
- Testing hypotheses ~ Day 2-3
- Working with business metrics and indicators ~ Day 3-4

# Introduction

This is an case study for the final project for the Practicum by Yandex curriculum.

**Telecom: Finding Clients With Non-Optimal Plans**
 
We work as analysts in a Telecommunication company, and we want to find customers that have non-optimal plans. With non-optimal plans we mean customers that either:
- Overpay for their current plans (as we do not want our customers to be unhappy and lose them to competition) or
- Need bigger plans than they already have (customers will be happier and we will have a higher and a more stable income)
